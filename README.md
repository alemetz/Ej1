## Practical Exercise

/* You have to create a centralized repository, which you should have access to from your local workspace, to achieve this, create your own repository on github.com and clone it into your local workspace. 

When you have your local and remote repository, let’s start making some changes!. Create a file in your local repository and add a text file called test.txt. Write into the created file, the  “Hello world” text. Save the file, create a version with these changes, and upload the version to the remote repository. After doing this process, check the remote repository to guarantee that there is a new version of the project, containing the test.txt file containing the “Hello World” text.
